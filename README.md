# ViolenceWithVeggies
Ready, set, farm! Rush to harvest as many crops as you can before time runs out. Fight for land against a friend or try to beat your own high score. But time’s not your only enemy, with weather events changing your planting plans, quickly till your soil, plant your vegetables, water, and put your harvest into your crate before snow kills your crops or the burning sun sets them on fire! Don’t stop, get going… get farming!
